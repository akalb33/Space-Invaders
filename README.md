# Space-Invaders
By Andrew Kalb

This is one of the first games I developed in C++ with help from my father.

It largely utilizes the SFML library, and contains a lot of code that is the framework for many of my other projects (specifically games) in C++. This is the reason the project is titled "GameFrame", because it was the initial game developed alongside our framework.

How to run this program:
 - Download the "GameFrame" folder and then launch the executable "GameFrame.exe".
